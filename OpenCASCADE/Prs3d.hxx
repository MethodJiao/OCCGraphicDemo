//! as color, width, and type of line are displayed;
//! these are generic objects, whereas those in
//! StdPrs are specific geometries and topologies.
//! -   generic   algorithms providing default settings for
//! objects such as points, curves, surfaces and shapes
//! -   a root object which provides the abstract
//! framework for the DsgPrs definitions at work in
//! display of dimensions, relations and trihedra.
