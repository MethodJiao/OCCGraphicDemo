//! Defines a class of objects with display and selection services.
//! Entities which are visualized and selected are
//! Interactive Objects. You can make use of classes of
//! standard Interactive Objects for which all necessary
//! methods have already been programmed, or you can
//! implement your own classes of Interactive Objects.
//! Specific attributes of entities such as arrow aspect for
//! dimensions must be loaded in a Drawer. This Drawer
//! is then applied to the Interactive Object in view.
//! There are four types of Interactive Object in AIS: the
//! construction element or Datum, the Relation, which
//! includes both dimensions and constraints, the Object,
//! and finally, when the object is of an unknown type, the None type.
//! Inside these categories, a signature, or index,
//! provides the possibility of additional characterization.
//! By default, the Interactive Object has a None type
//! and a signature of 0. If you want to give a particular
//! type and signature to your interactive object, you must
//! redefine the methods, Signature and Type.
//! Warning
//! In the case of attribute methods, methods for
//! standard attributes are virtual. They must be
//! redefined   by the inheriting classes. Setcolor for a
//! point and Setcolor for a plane, for example, do not
//! affect the same attributes in the Drawer.
